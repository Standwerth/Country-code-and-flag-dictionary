# Country-code-and-flag-dictionary

Note: The repository only includes a single file with the dictionary inside it and not a whole Xcode project. So I advise you to copy the code and paste it into your project directly instead of cloning the project since it is a fully fletched project, only a single file.
A dictionary I created that includes a country's ISO 3166-2 as well as its corresponding flag. Note that there are some regions that lack a flag (often a former colony), in which case the most relevant flag is being used as a substitute.
